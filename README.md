# UFOs
## Overview of Project
Using JavaScript to create a dynamic webpage on UFO sightings. The webpage displays data on various UFO sightings in a table format. Users are able to filter the data in the table to refine their search based on date, city, state, country and shape. 

## Results
To the left of the table on UFO sightings is a section that allows users to apply filters and refine their search, as shown below.
![Filters](https://github.com/mdhugge/UFOs/blob/main/static/images/Filters.png)
Users can refine their search based on Date, City, State, Country and Shape.

### Using Search Criteria
The user can enter a value into each of the input boxes and than press ENTER in order to filter the table.

#### Filtering for Date
The date should be enetered in the format of Month/Day/Year (e.g. January 13, 2010 would be entered as 1/13/2010).

Applying a date filter of 1/13/2010 would return the following result:
![Date_Filter](https://github.com/mdhugge/UFOs/blob/main/static/images/Date_Filter.png)

#### Filtering for City
The city should be enetered in all lower case letters (e.g. El Cajon would be entered as el cajon).

Applying a city filter of el cajon would return the following result:
![City_Filter](https://github.com/mdhugge/UFOs/blob/main/static/images/City_Filter.png)

#### Filtering for State
The state should be enetered in with the two letter state abbreviation (e.g. Pennsylvania would be entered as pa).

Applying a state filter of pa would return the following result:
![State_Filter](https://github.com/mdhugge/UFOs/blob/main/static/images/State_Filter.png)

#### Filtering for Country
The country should be enetered in with the two letter country abbreviation (e.g. Canada would be entered as ca).

Applying a country filter of ca would return the following result:
![Country_Filter](https://github.com/mdhugge/UFOs/blob/main/static/images/Country_Filter.png)

#### Filtering for Shape
The should should be enetered in all lower case (e.g. Circle would be entered as circle).

Applying a shape filter of circle would return the following result:
![Shape_Filter](https://github.com/mdhugge/UFOs/blob/main/static/images/Shape_Filter.png)

### Filter Value Does Not Exists
If the filter value entered by the user does not exist an empty table will be returned. 

Applying a shape filter of diamond would return the following result:
![Diamond_Filter](https://github.com/mdhugge/UFOs/blob/main/static/images/Diamond_Filter.png)

### Multiple Filters
Users can also enter values for multiple categories.

Applying the folloing filters: Date = 1/13/20, City = el cajon, State = ca, Country = us, Shape = triangle would return the following result:
![All_Filter](https://github.com/mdhugge/UFOs/blob/main/static/images/All_Filter.png)
## Summary
In a summary statement, describe one drawback of this new design and two recommendations for further development.
